# Fix It Now!

![stability](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-WIP-lightgrey)

This is my front-end capstone project that I created while participating in the [Nashville Software School - Full Stack Web Developer Python/Django](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com).

The goal of this project is to build an application which helps document service outage incidents and communicate those outages to the public, as part of a robust incident management process.

One of the things Iâ€™ve faced in my career of working with various systems, is that communicating updates with all potential stakeholders (public or internal) and then maintaining a record of that communication for later analyses can be difficult (this also includes the spousal unit at home for the various technologies the family uses).  This is my attempt at creating a centralized, easy-to-update application that supports those goals.
